### Completeing work

I will be setting work via the issues tracker with deadlines. Work will be assigned to you and I expect it to be met within the dealine. If you cannot complete the work please comment on the issue, try not to use the Group Chat for specific work discussion as its much easy to keep track via the issues.

#### Committing work

DO NOT COMMIT TO THE MAIN BRANCH

##### How??

Clone the repo

    git clone http://github.com/freshollie/206CDE.git
 
Then when you want to make your own changes

    git checkout -b issue-number
 
Make your changes. I expect documents to be submitted as PDFs in the correct folders

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your message"
  
This might be the name of the work, why you are commiting, anything really I just want to be able to see what you have changed.

    git push --set-upstream origin issue-number
 
And thats it, I will merge your changes if I feel they are correct


  

### About
Our task is to solve a real world problem and we will be using this repository for keeping track of the project.
